Cabpool
=======

This is an Android application that will function as a carpooling and taxi service that uses NFCs for payment.

This is a class project as students at McMaster University for our class, SFWR ENG 3A04.



Hi guys,
just import the following files into CabShare:

1. appcompatv7
2. BarCodeTest
3. MapNavigator-master
4. You need to have *Google Play Services* installed from your SDK Manager, then import: `adt-bundle/sdk/extras/google/google_play_services/libproject/google-play-services_lib`
5. And don't forget the big one -- CabShare

IMPORTANT: import projects and set all of them as libraries to CabShare It should work, I m fighting with u guys, we will be fine this time!Just hurry up!

> **WARNING**: this project has been abandoned. The project is also unfinished.
